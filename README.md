# magura_hut_project_2

A local ecommerce app made with android studio (Kotlin).

This app basically depends on a website and the database of the app itself is firebase. 
But I used rest api of the website to actually sync the website database with firebase.
As that seemed the most efficient and fast way to do that at that specific time.

The admin panel app actually manages the data syncing and order management etc.

This app has :
* Firebase realtime database as the database.
* Firebase auth as the auth and otp for login.
* General location tracking system for location tracking.
* Realtime products update.

And A lot other features.

I've tried to actually follow mvvm in the app but I couldn't properly do it because of 
lack of time and upcoming exam pressure.

:D
